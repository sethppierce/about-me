    <p id="main">Hello! My name is Seth Pierce! I am orginially from very south Louisiana, but moved to Georgia after Hurricane Katrina. I play a ton of video games, watch a lot of anime, and watch an absurd amount of football, pretty much how ever many games can fit on three monitors. But I am a dedicated Saints (WHO DAT) and LSU Tigers fan. Classmates if you wanna talk football I am always down. My goals are to complete this class, 301, and 401 for JavaScript! I have a ton of friends that work for various big tech companies in Seattle and love it so I my goal is to get a job in Seattle doing the same thing! That's pretty much everything about me! I can't wait to read all of your pages!! </p>
