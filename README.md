### Questions

- How did this go overall?- It was pretty easy since most of it we covered in 102 but it was good to get a little refresher over stuff we've covered and I felt a lot more confident this time around.
- What observations or questions do you have about what youâ€™ve learned so far?- I don't have any questions so far and the only observations I have are about how much I've absorbed so far. I felt really good about doing this and it let me explore more of css that I didn't do previously.
- How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And, before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment?- It took me around an hour and a half because I tried some new stuff that I haven't done with CSS before. I thought it would take me around 30 minutes to do the main stuff but I didn't know how long I'd spend on the styling.

### Today I learned

Today was a great refresher for information learned in the previous classes and I think I really got a hang of things today. I learned some great new stuff with CSS while doing the lab and got my website looking the way I wanted it to do, so it made me feel really good and comfortable with all the stuff we've done! Some new stuff I learned today was how to use the position property and values to make things sticky and scroll with the page, or to make them centered on the page. I also got more comfortable with the terminology and strive to get a lot better with that.
